                I am so honoured to be chairing this committee again and to do my utmost to honour the intersections of women we represent in Vancouver. I want to make sure we celebrate women's achievements, represent women from all walks of life and continue to fight the abundance of struggles women face worldwide - all whilst recognizing self-identifying women's diversity.

                I'm so grateful to return to this committee and build on the amazing work we did last year. To me, IWD is about amplifying voices and opening our hearts to the experiences of others. It's also about taking steps forward and calling on our allies and those in power to commit to real change. I'm so excited for the march and can't wait to see you all there!

                As a visibly racialized migrant woman, being a member of the IWD Vancouver Committee is an avenue to represent my community. An opportunity to speak at tables where we often do not get the chance to. I am very thankful and excited to be able to be a part of something that symbolizes the coming together of voices that are often unheard.

                I am so happy and honoured to be a member of the IWD Vancouver Committee this year because it represents a powerful and meaningful opportunity for me to be a voice for those who may not have one, to raise awareness about women's rights and gender equality, and to take concrete actions to make a positive difference in women’s lives. Being part of this team is a means for me to stand up for women's rights, equality, and safety, and to send a message that women should be supported, respected, and empowered.

                I'm beyond thrilled to return to the IWD Vancouver committee. We live in a diverse and beautiful community, but diverse voices are rarely adequately represented within media or our community. I'm passionate about platforming the voices of amazing community activists and the tireless work they do. Hosting the IWD march is an important step in the right direction.

                for most of this year, feelings of grief and helplessness have been heavy. my involvement means being in community to hold space for heartbreak, for healing, and for imaginative futures. to me, being involved in the IWD committee is where i am mobilized, hopeful, and joyful, as i stand in solidarity with my local and global community coming together for the sake of collective liberation.
