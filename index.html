            <h2>What is IWD Vancouver?</h2>
            <h3>Mission statement</h3>
            <p>International Women's Day March Vancouver works to celebrate, amplify and fight alongside the diversity of women in our community to achieve equity and create awareness of issues self-identifying women in Vancouver face.</p>
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p>We stand for equity, and recognize intersectionality and diversity. These are often empty words, but in everything we do we strive to consider how each of those key words affect the individual communities that make up our larger community of self-identified women.</p>              
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>We aim to host the international women's day march every year in March as well as promote events hosted by grassroots organizations around Vancouver. We want to ensure everything we do creates a safe space for women and highlight the intersectional issues we face.</p>                           
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>We will plan the international women's day march every year. We will call on our allies to recognize our struggles and fight alongside us. We will promote other events from our communities that aim to achieve equity. We will create a space for volunteers that is safe and inclusive. We will create a platform where we can educate and inform those in our community of the history, battles and victories of the women's equity movement.</p>
