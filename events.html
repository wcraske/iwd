            <p>
                Solidarity Notes Labour Choir is a group of activists who know that music is more than pleasurable sound. It’s a powerful language to
                 educate and connect us and remind us of our strength and history. We find consistently that when we sing, people's sense of hope is
                  reinforced, and their resolve is strengthened. Everyone is welcome, there's no audition, and no obligation to pay (though we do accept voluntary dues). 
                  We are ordinary people who like to sing and contribute to social change.
